## TL;DR
I am a tech enthusiast, and have been my whole life. I host my own networks and servers for fun. I find it facinating that you can send a piece of information around the world in a few milliseconds.

## Personal Life
I'm originally from Kiltimagh, County Mayo, a small town with a huge heart. I moved to Galway City three years ago to start my career as a Computer Scientist with the help of NUI Galway.
As my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/mcgovman) states:  
> ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Farming, REST APIs and Irish Folklore  
> ðŸ’¼ Currently working as an Associate Software Engineer in Genesys  
> ðŸ˜Š Proudest of My involvement with [NUI Galway's Computer Society](https://compsoc.ie)  

## NUI Galway CompSoc
